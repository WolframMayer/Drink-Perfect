# Drink-Perfect
You will never again forget your beer in the freezer or burn your tongue on your hot tea.

Everybody knows it: Friends come over to have a beer and chat a little. You forgot to put beer in the cooler, so now you have just one option left: put the beer in the freezer.
Your friends come and have bought some beer on the way. You talk for a while and have a nice evening.
The next day you look into your freezer and everything you can see is broken glass and some frozen beer all over your stuff. You forgot the beer in the freezer the other night...

To avoid these moments and the annoying cleaning session afterwards, we've thought of a nice gadget to attach to your beer. In the app you can set the temperature and will get a push notificiation when the beer has reached the perfect temperature.

The gadget can also be attached to other drinks like tea (to know when the perfect drink temperature is reached and to avoid that it becomes ice tea) or wine. The desired temperature can be set in the app which will remind you via a push notification on your smartphone when that temperature is reached.
